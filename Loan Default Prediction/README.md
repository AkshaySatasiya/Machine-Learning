# Loan Default Prediction with Decision Trees and Random Forests Classifier

## Overview
This project uses machine learning models, specifically the Decision Tree Classifier and Random Forest Classifier, to predict loan default. The goal is to assist financial institutions in assessing the credit risk of loan applicants, thereby improving lending decisions and reducing potential losses.

## Project Description
Loan default prediction is a critical task for financial institutions to ensure responsible lending practices. This project leverages machine learning to build predictive models that evaluate the likelihood of a borrower defaulting on a loan. Decision Trees and Random Forests are employed to make accurate predictions based on historical loan data.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project was obtained from Kaggle, a popular platform for data science competitions and datasets.
